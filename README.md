## "Sort-a" Mysfits
http://wit-cc-a5-ngov.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

## Introduction
Mythical Mysfits is a pet adoption website dedicated to fictional creatures. We've added functionality to the website to increase sorting options as well as to gain an understanding on user actions through recording what they click. We've also attempted to increase the security of our application using AWS Cognito + AWS Certificate Manager, though these could not be implemented due to AWS Educate restrictions.
